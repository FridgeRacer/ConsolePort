# ConsolePort
<h2>What's this fork for?</h2>
This is simply an attempt to add support for the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, and by effect support for combined Joy-Cons.
Currently the goal is to integrate the Switch Pro Controller into the UI neatly. Regardless, the user will have to use the controller through an <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/wireless-usb-adapter/" target="_blank">8BitDo Wireless USB Adapter</a> or via USB with <a href="https://github.com/Davidobot/BetterJoy" target="_blank">BetterJoy</a> to actually use the controller.

<h2>What is ConsolePort?</h2>
ConsolePort is an interface add-on for World of Warcraft that will give you a handful of nifty features
in order to let you play the game on a controller - without inconvenience.
<br/><br/>
Consisting of several independent modules, ConsolePort is a fully-fledged solution to handling all the quirks in a game where gamepad support was not intended,
including interface navigation, custom-tailored UI elements to assist in gameplay, and easy-to-use targeting systems
for end-game content. As of Shadowlands, ConsolePort uses native gamepad controls. No external software is required.
